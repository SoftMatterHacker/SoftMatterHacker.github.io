## What we do

* Focus on the understanding, design, and creation of soft materials and complex liquid microstructures in commercial products, biological tissues, and even soft robots.

* Maintain strength in microscopy, for quantitative study of soft material structures, and rheology, for measurement of flow and mechanical properties.

* Enable the development of novel active ingredient delivery methods for consumer products, respiratory delivery technologies for pharmaceuticals, and even new insights into environmental phenomena like thunderstorm asthma.

* Work with industry and academic partners to understand complex fluid product and material performance and design novel complex fluid materials and products.

* More background on our group and members can be found at our UNSW site and in this post.

* Prospective PhD and honours students: check our research projects page to see where you might want to work.

## Research areas

* Formulated product development and scale-up - Develop and evaluate innovative microstructured fluid products with biological and industrial relevance.

* Rheology measurement and design - Novel approaches to understanding the microstructure behind commercial fluid flows and performance

* 3D printing - Use surprising materials to print three-dimensional designs. How will your new food, biomaterial, cosmetic, or coating behave when you try to 3D print with it?

* Engineered nanocellulose - Harness bacterial producers of cellulose nanofibers to weave, template, and manufacture advanced materials.

* Emulsions and their shapes - Emulsion droplets are used in vaccines, pesticides, cosmetics, and foods by dispersing one liquid, like an oil, in another, like water.

* Cubosome and hexosome nanoparticles - Nanostructured liquid crystal particles with unique shape and biological function.
