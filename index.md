[![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages?style=social)](https://github.com/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages)

A [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) template project for [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

* A full Bootstrap 4 theme usable both on Github Pages and with a standalone Jekyll.
* Recompiles Bootstrap from SCSS files, which allows to customize Bootstrap's variables and use Bootstrap themes.
* Full support of Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins.
* Supports all features of Github Pages and Jekyll.

## Setup Guide

### Create a repository from this template

* [Go to this repository page on Github](https://github.com/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages).
* Click the `Star` button on the top right. (OK, this step is facultative, but that would make you a nice person)
* Click the `Use this template` button on the top right of the page.

### Choose a name for your repository

Here we have two possibilities:

* **You want a user or organization website**

  In this case your website's URL will be `http://<your username>.github.io` where `<your username>` is your Github user name.

  Choose the repository name `<your username>.github.io`.

* **You want a project website**

  In this case your website's URL will be `http://<your username>.github.io/<whatever you want>` where `<whatever you want>` can be any valid name for a Github repository.

  Choose the repository name `<whatever you want>`.

### Activate Github Pages on your repository

Go in the `Settings` page of your repository, in the `Github Pages`, under the `Source` parameter, choose `master branch` then `Save`.

### That's it

Your Github Pages website with customizable Bootstrap 4 is now up and running, you can access it using the URL displayed by Github in the `Github Pages` settings.

## What we do

* Focus on the understanding, design, and creation of soft materials and complex liquid microstructures in commercial products, biological tissues, and even soft robots.

* Maintain strength in microscopy, for quantitative study of soft material structures, and rheology, for measurement of flow and mechanical properties.

* Enable the development of novel active ingredient delivery methods for consumer products, respiratory delivery technologies for pharmaceuticals, and even new insights into environmental phenomena like thunderstorm asthma.

* Work with industry and academic partners to understand complex fluid product and material performance and design novel complex fluid materials and products.

* More background on our group and members can be found at our UNSW site and in this post.

* Prospective PhD and honours students: check our research projects page to see where you might want to work.

### 

You probably don't want the present guide to be the front page of your website, so you should edit the `index.md` file. You probably also want to edit or delete the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` files.

Aside from that you can of course create new pages and posts like with any Jekyll website by refering to the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/).
