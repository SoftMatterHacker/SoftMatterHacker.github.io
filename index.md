## What we do - People

* Focus on the understanding, design, and creation of soft materials and complex liquid microstructures in commercial products, biological tissues, and even soft robots.

* Maintain strength in microscopy, for quantitative study of soft material structures, and rheology, for measurement of flow and mechanical properties.

* Enable the development of novel active ingredient delivery methods for consumer products, respiratory delivery technologies for pharmaceuticals, and even new insights into environmental phenomena like thunderstorm asthma.

* Work with industry and academic partners to understand complex fluid product and material performance and design novel complex fluid materials and products.

* More background on our group and members can be found at our UNSW site and in this post.

* Prospective PhD and honours students: check our research projects page to see where you might want to work.

## Research areas - Project pages

* Formulated product development and scale-up - Develop and evaluate innovative microstructured fluid products with biological and industrial relevance.

* Rheology measurement and design - Novel approaches to understanding the microstructure behind commercial fluid flows and performance

* 3D printing - Use surprising materials to print three-dimensional designs. How will your new food, biomaterial, cosmetic, or coating behave when you try to 3D print with it?

* Engineered nanocellulose - Harness bacterial producers of cellulose nanofibers to weave, template, and manufacture advanced materials.

* Emulsions and their shapes - Emulsion droplets are used in vaccines, pesticides, cosmetics, and foods by dispersing one liquid, like an oil, in another, like water.

* Cubosome and hexosome nanoparticles - Nanostructured liquid crystal particles with unique shape and biological function.

## Biography

Pat Spicer received a BS in Chemical Engineering from the University of Delaware in 1992. In 1997 he completed a PhD in Chemical Engineering with the Particle Technology Group at the University of Cincinnati. There his research focused on design and synthesis of colloidal and nanoparticle materials. After defending his thesis, he went to work for the Procter & Gamble Company, leading their Crystallization group in the Corporate Engineering Division and supporting the scale-up and manufacture of complex fluid products for all of P&G's product areas.

Recognizing the importance of fluid microstructures to product and process quality, in 2006 Pat formed P&G's Microfluidics and Structured Fluids group, responsible for development, characterization, scale-up, and modeling of microstructured fluids and processes. Utilizing broad capability in microscopy, microfluidics, and microrheology, the Mu Crew made significant contributions to all of P&G's liquid billion dollar brands and collaborated with many of the leading academic groups focused on soft materials and complex fluids.

After 15 years with P&G, Pat began work as an Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. There his research focuses on the design and development of microstructured fluid materials by understanding their kinetic behavior. His areas of focus in the field include the understanding of particle shape effects on materials performance, interactions of soft matter with biological systems, and scale-up of soft matter manufacturing processes when attributes other than composition control product quality.
