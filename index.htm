What we do
</h3>
<ul>
<li> Focus on the understanding, design, and creation of soft materials and 
complex liquid microstructures in commercial products, biological tissues, and even soft robots.

<li> Maintain strength in microscopy, for 
quantitative study of soft material structures, and rheology, for measurement of flow and mechanical 
properties.
<li> Enable the development of novel active ingredient delivery methods for consumer 
products, respiratory delivery technologies for pharmaceuticals, and even new insights into 
environmental phenomena like thunderstorm asthma.

<li> Work with industry and academic partners to understand complex fluid product and material performance and 
design novel complex fluid materials and products.

<li> More background on our group and members can be found at our <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-patrick-spicer">UNSW site</a> and <a href="./post/whoweare.htm">in this post</a>.

Biography
</h3>
<p class = "bio">
Pat Spicer received a BS in Chemical Engineering from the University of Delaware in 1992.  
In 1997 he completed a PhD in Chemical Engineering with the Particle Technology Group at 
the University of Cincinnati. There his research focused on design and synthesis of colloidal 
and nanoparticle materials. After defending his thesis, he went to work for the 
Procter & Gamble Company, leading their Crystallization group in the Corporate Engineering 
Division and supporting the scale-up and manufacture of complex fluid products for all of 
P&G's product areas. <br /><br />

Recognizing the importance of fluid microstructures to product and process quality, 
in 2006 Pat formed P&G's Microfluidics and Structured Fluids group, responsible for 
development, characterization, scale-up, and modeling of microstructured fluids and 
processes. Utilizing broad capability in microscopy, microfluidics, and microrheology, 
the Mu Crew made significant contributions to all of P&G's liquid billion dollar brands and 
collaborated with many of the leading academic groups focused on soft materials and complex fluids. <br /><br />

After 15 years with P&G, Pat began work as an Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering at 
the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.  There his research focuses on the 
design and development of microstructured fluid materials by understanding their kinetic behavior.  
His areas of focus in the field include the understanding of particle shape effects on materials 
performance, interactions of soft matter with biological systems, and scale-up of soft matter 
manufacturing processes when attributes other than composition control product quality.<br /><br />
